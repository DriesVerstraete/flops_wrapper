OpenMDAO component wrapper for FLOPS (FLight OPtimization System). Note, this
wrapper is based on FLOPS 8.11, and is purely a file wrap. FLOPS has a large
number of input variables and settings, so it is possible that there are still
some issues in generating the input files for some configurations that haven't
been tested. Please contact us if you have any unexpected behavior, so that we
can fix it.

Note: this installation does not include FLOPS. You must obtain that separately
through the proper channels.
